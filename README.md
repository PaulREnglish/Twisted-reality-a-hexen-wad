## Twisted Reality (a hexen mod for the gzdoom source port)

This is a hexen mod I made that runs on the source port gzdoom.
It contains non-Euclidean geometry - sometimes, when you look behind
you, the room is different to the one you were just in!  I've also 
modified one of the monsters to better predict the player's movement
patterns so that they can lead their shots.  For more information see
the enclosed Twisted_Reality.txt file.

### How I edit the file
To edit and view the file, I use Slade which is free.

### How to play the wad
To play the wad you need the free source port gzdoom and the
not-so-free hexen iwad which you buy on steam.  Fortunately, ShadesMan has
done a video of them playing my map which you can watch on youtube:
